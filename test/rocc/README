This tests basic RoCC accelerator functionality using the default dummy_rocc
accelerator included with spike. You may use this as a template for writing
bare-metal software for RoCC accelerators.

# Key Files
* crt.S: Initializes the system and sets up the basic runtime. This eliminates the need for an OS.
* rocc.h: These are helper macros for constructing RoCC instructions
* syscalls.c: This implements a subset of the C standard library. We do not
  include all of C, so you'll need to implement whatever you need that isn't
  there.
* link.ld: This instructs the linker to setup the binary as a standalone
  bootable image on the bare-metal hardware without any OS.
* rocc-test.c: This is our actual benchmark. For the most part, a new project
  would only need to modify this file.

# Usage
Build with:
    make

Run on Spike with:
    spike --extension=dummy_rocc rocc-test.riscv

Run in Marshal:
    ./marshal build test/rocc.json
    ./marshal launch -s test/rocc.json

or:
    ./marshal test -s test/rocc.json
