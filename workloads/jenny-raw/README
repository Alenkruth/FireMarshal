Add whatever raw img and binary you want in this directory and call them "raw-bin" and "raw.img".

You can launch qemu using:
./sw-manager.py -c workloads/jenny-raw.json launch

don't run build or anything (it probably won't do anything, but don't risk it).
If you want to boot those images in firesim, just update the symlinks in your deploy/workloads/foo directory appropriately.
